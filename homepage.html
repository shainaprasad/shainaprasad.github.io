                            I was born and raised by the Bay in the suburbs of San Francisco and currently reside near the waves in
                            SF.<br /><br />My curiosity of the human condition and its nuances drove me to study Sociology and User
                            Experience, and eventually become a mixed-methods researcher. Over the last 6 years, this has led me
                            through a variety of ventures from climate justice to tech to education, and taught me how these all
                            intersect in the highly complex world we live in.<br /><br />I have been an educator, writer, and
                            program/project manager in the past, which shaped my scope of work and ability to empathize with unique
                            groups. I am experienced with a range of clients, budgets, and goals.<br /><br />I find excitement in
                            solving complex problems with innovative approaches and enjoy thinking outside the box to make impactful
                            change. My specialties lie in my ability to ensure inclusivity when selecting methods or target users.
